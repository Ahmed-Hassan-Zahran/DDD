1- Shift all business validation to the Aggregate/Entity as much as you can.
1- Between Presentation and Application Layer (DTOs)
2- Object mapping applied from entity to outputDTO to be returned to the presentation.
- Do not use object mapping to create the entity as it will ignore the business validation.
2- Between Application Layer and Domain (Entities)
3- Business Rules in Entities.
If business rule outside the entity move it to the domain service
4- If business rules related to more than one entity then put it in Domain Service.
5- For aggregates, Business rules should be maintained in aggregate roots.
6- Custom repositories should be implemented in the Entity framework project while its interface will be in the domain
